# Portfolio

## Description 

The goal of this project was to refactor our portfolio and bring it up to speed with the new frameworks we have been working with. This may look very similar to my bootstrap only portfolio but there is a lot more going on under the hood. This webpage is powered by react and it is responsible for all of the modularizing of the webiste and how it is broken down into different componenets. This lends itself well to resuablity, when I need to update this in the future it will be much easier. For the layout of the webpage I decided to use bootstrap as it is the CSS framework I have the most experience with and know I could get the most out of it. The finished site was to have a polished look which is accomplished, the site is modern and clean, giving this portfolio a great look. It has a mobile first design so it looks good on any viewport and easy to read font and colors that do not cause eyestrain to the user. Tried to take a modern, simplistic approach when styling the webpage. It has all the links that you would expect from a computer programmer, including github, linkedin and showcases all of the projects that I am proud of doing. Overall this portfolio has a good approachable design that lays out all the appropriate things a good portfolio should.

## Installation

Once you have done a git clone you are free to start working on this project. If you want to push your changes to my repo then you would have to head into terminal/bash and do a git add . Then a git commit -m explaning the changes made, and finally a git push to push the files onto the repo.

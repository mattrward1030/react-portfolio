            <p>
                Hello world...I am a computer programmer and recent graduate of the full stack front end bootcamp
                at UPenn. I am located in South Jersey, right outside of Philadelphia. Not only am I a
                programmer but also a full-time father to the most amazing boy in the
                entire world! I am chasing my dream of making a career in this field and I hope you follow along
                with me on my journey. My drive and passion for programming comes from two things I love in
                life, problem solving and technology. I have always been someone who looks at really just about
                anything and thinks to myself, how can I improve upon it. I had always had ideas of how to do
                this, whether it be building an entirely new application or bettering what already exists. I
                just didn't have the technical background to do so, now I am able to and it is truly exciting.
                Be
                sure to stop back often to see what
                I've been working on!
                    </p>
